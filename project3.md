## Project description

This project required implementing a complete sorted map data structure in C++ without using STL map or unordered_map.  
Keys (names) are stored in sorted order, and values (IDs) are stored in parallel.  
Binary search is used for efficient lookup, prefix counting, and verifying sorted ordering.

This project strengthened my understanding of maintaining ordered structures, implementing efficient search algorithms, and using vectors across multiple C++ files.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
make
./map-test
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Below Fig 1. shows successful output performing add, removing, and lookup operations.

## Additional Considerations
This project demonstrates sorted insertion using a binary search and parallel vector management.
