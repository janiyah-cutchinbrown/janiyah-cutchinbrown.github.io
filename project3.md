===============

-   **Class: CSCI 415
-   **Grade: A
-   **Language(s): C++
-   **Source Code Repository:** [features/mastering-markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Project description

This programming assignment required implementing several C++ features across multiple tasks, including:

- A templated class with a defined array size  
- Displaying integer and floating-point values from templated storage  
- Using a generic `mySwap()` function to swap values  
- Debugging and correcting a faulty default copy constructor  
- Using pointers — not array indexing — to remove odd numbers from a sorted array  
- Sorting words from a file based on byte positions using `tellg()` and `tellp()`  

This assignment strengthened my understanding of C++ templates, memory management, pointer arithmetic, and algorithmic thinking.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o ./main
./main
```

## UI Design

Below Fig 1. shows example output displaying template storage values printed from the program.

## Additional Considerations
This project improved my skills in template-based programming, pointer manipulation, and deep v. shallow copying in C++.
