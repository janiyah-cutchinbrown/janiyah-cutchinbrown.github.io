## Project description

This project involved designing an Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a Donor & Event Management System, then mapping that design into a full relational schema.


## UI Design

The ERD includes strong entities, associative entities, composite attributes, foreign keys and cardinality constraints, and relationships. The final design supports tracking donations, pledges, affiliations, events,  and payments in a normalized SQL database.

## Additional Considerations
This project demonstrates sorted insertion using a binary search and parallel vector management.
