## Project description

This project involved creating comprehensive database documentatino for a Donor & Event Management System, including a detailed Data Dictionary and Cross Reference Table. These documents define the structure, constraints, and relationships of the database schema implemented in SQL.

The Data Dictionary lists each table's attributes, data types, keys, and detailed descriptions, while the Cross Reference Table maps relationships and foreign keys between entities to clarify their interconnections.

## UI Design

Data Dictionary: Precise definition of tables, columns, data types, and constraints ensuring clarity and consistency for development and maintenance.

Cross Reference Table: Visualizs and documents the relational connections between entities, supporting referential integrity and system navigation.
