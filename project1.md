## Project description

This project demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts in Python through the implementation of several class files, including a `RightTriangle` class. The program initializes a right triangle with two side lengths and computes both the hypotenuse and surface area. This lab strengthened my understanding of class design, constructors, attributes, and modular Python structure.


## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ~/CSCI-301-code-repository/lab06
python3 RightTriangle.py

```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design
  Below is a screenshot of the RightTriangle class calculating the hypotenuse and surface area.
